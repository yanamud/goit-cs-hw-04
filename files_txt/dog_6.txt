A Dark Brown Dog

6

The child beat his pursuer with a small stick he had found. 
The dog lay down and prayed until the child had finished, and resumed his journey. 
Then he scrambled erect and took up the pursuit again.

On the way to his home the child turned many times and beat the dog, 
proclaiming with childish gestures that he held him in contempt as an unimportant dog, 
with no value save for a moment. For being this quality of animal the dog apologized 
and eloquently expressed regret, but he continued stealthily to follow the child. 
His manner grew so very guilty that he slunk like an assassin.
