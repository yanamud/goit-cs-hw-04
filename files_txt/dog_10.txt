A Dark Brown Dog

10

A family council was held. On this depended the dog's fate, but he in no way heeded, 
being busily engaged in chewing the end of the child's dress.

The affair was quickly ended. The father of the family, 
it appears, was in a particularly savage temper that evening, 
and when he perceived that it would amaze and anger everybody if such a dog were allowed to remain, 
he decided that it should be so. The child, crying softly, took his friend off 
to a retired part of the room to hobnob with him, while the father quelled a fierce rebellion of his wife. 
So it came to pass that the dog was a member of the household.

He and the child were associated together at all times save when the child slept. 
The child became a guardian and a friend. 
If the large folk kicked the dog and threw things at him, the child made loud and violent objections. 
Once when the child had run, protesting loudly, with tears raining down his face and his arms outstretched, 
to protect his friend, he had been struck in the head with a very large saucepan from the hand of his father, 
enraged at some seeming lack of courtesy in the dog. Ever after, the family were careful 
how they threw things at the dog. Moreover, the latter grew very skilful in avoiding missiles and feet. 
In a small room containing a stove, a table, a bureau and some chairs, he would display 
strategic ability of a high order, dodging, feinting and scuttling about among the furniture. 
He could force three or four people armed with brooms, sticks and handfuls of coal, 
to use all their ingenuity to get in a blow. And even when they did, 
it was seldom that they could do him a serious injury or leave any imprint.
