A Dark Brown Dog

8

He dragged his captive into a hall and up many long stairways in a dark tenement. 
The dog made willing efforts, but he could not hobble very skilfully up the stairs 
because he was very small and soft, and at last the pace of the engrossed child 
grew so energetic that the dog became panic-stricken. In his mind he was being 
dragged toward a grim unknown. His eyes grew wild with the terror of it. 
He began to wiggle his head frantically and to brace his legs.

The child redoubled his exertions. They had a battle on the stairs. 
The child was victorious because he was completely absorbed in his purpose, 
and because the dog was very small. He dragged his acquirement to the door of his home, 
and finally with triumph across the threshold.
