A Dark Brown Dog

4

He looked so comical on his back, and holding his paws peculiarly, 
that the child was greatly amused and gave him little taps repeatedly, 
to keep him so. But the little dark-brown dog took this chastisement 
in the most serious way, and no doubt considered that he had committed 
some grave crime, for he wriggled contritely and showed his repentance 
in every way that was in his power. 
He pleaded with the child and petitioned him, and offered more prayers.
