A Dark Brown Dog

2

After a time, a little dark-brown dog came trotting with an intent air down the sidewalk. 
A short rope was dragging from his neck. Occasionally he trod upon the end of it and stumbled.

He stopped opposite the child, and the two regarded each other. 
The dog hesitated for a moment, but presently he made some little advances with his tail. 
The child put out his hand and called him. 
In an apologetic manner the dog came close, and the two had an interchange of friendly pattings and waggles. 
The dog became more enthusiastic with each moment of the interview, 
until with his gleeful caperings he threatened to overturn the child. 
Whereupon the child lifted his hand and struck the dog a blow upon the head.
