A Dark Brown Dog

9

No one was in. The child sat down on the floor and made overtures to the dog. 
These the dog instantly accepted. He beamed with affection upon his new friend. 
In a short time they were firm and abiding comrades.

When the child's family appeared, they made a great row. 
The dog was examined and commented upon and called names. 
Scorn was leveled at him from all eyes, so that he became much embarrassed and 
drooped like a scorched plant. 
But the child went sturdily to the center of the floor, and, at the top of his voice, 
championed the dog. It happened that he was roaring protestations, with his arms 
clasped about the dog's neck, when the father of the family came in from work.

The parent demanded to know what the blazes they were making the kid howl for. 
It was explained in many words that the infernal 
kid wanted to introduce a disreputable dog into the family.
