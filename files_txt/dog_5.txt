A Dark Brown Dog

5

At last the child grew weary of this amusement and turned toward home. 
The dog was praying at the time. He lay on his back and turned his eyes upon the retreating form.

Presently he struggled to his feet and started after the child. 
The latter wandered in a perfunctory way toward his home, stopping at times to investigate various matters. 
During one of these pauses he discovered the little dark-brown dog who was following him with the air of a footpad.
