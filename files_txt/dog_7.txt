A Dark Brown Dog

7

When the child reached his door-step, the dog was industriously ambling a few yards in the rear. 
He became so agitated with shame when he again confronted the child that he forgot the dragging rope. 
He tripped upon it and fell forward.

The child sat down on the step and the two had another interview. 
During it the dog greatly exerted himself to please the child. 
He performed a few gambols with such abandon that the child suddenly saw him to be a valuable thing. 
He made a swift, avaricious charge and seized the rope.
