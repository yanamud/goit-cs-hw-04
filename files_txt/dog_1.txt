A Dark Brown Dog

1

A child was standing on a street-corner. 
He leaned with one shoulder against a high board-fence and swayed the other to and fro, 
the while kicking carelessly at the gravel.

Sunshine beat upon the cobbles, and a lazy summer wind raised yellow dust 
which trailed in clouds down the avenue. Clattering trucks moved with indistinctness through it. 
The child stood dreamily gazing.
