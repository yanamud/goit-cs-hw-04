A Dark Brown Dog

12

However, the child could not always be near. At night, when he was asleep, 
his dark-brown friend would raise from some black corner a wild, wailful cry, 
a song of infinite lowliness and despair, that would go shuddering and sobbing among 
the buildings of the block and cause people to swear. At these times the singer 
would often be chased all over the kitchen and hit with a great variety of articles.

Sometimes, too, the child himself used to beat the dog, although it is not known that 
he ever had what could be truly called a just cause. The dog always accepted these thrashings 
with an air of admitted guilt. He was too much of a dog to try to look to be a martyr or to plot revenge. 
He received the blows with deep humility, and furthermore he forgave his friend the moment the child had finished, 
and was ready to caress the child's hand with his little red tongue.
